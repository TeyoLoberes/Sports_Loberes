    <br>

    <p>1. Archery<br>
        Archery has long been practiced in the Philippines, particularly by indigenous groups. It was not only used for hunting but also for warfare. Archers would use bows made from bamboo or wood, and arrows would often be tipped with sharp materials like bone or metal. This skill was passed down through generations, especially in rural areas.<br><br>

        2. Arnis<br>
        Arnis (also known as Eskrima or Kali) is a Filipino martial art that focuses on weapon-based combat, particularly with sticks, knives, and other bladed weapons. It also includes empty-hand techniques, and it is widely regarded as one of the most effective self-defense systems. Arnis is still practiced today, both in the Philippines and globally.<br><br>

        3. Horse-riding<br>
        Horseback riding, or equestrian sports, were prevalent among Filipino nobility and warriors. The skill of riding was used for both transportation and battle. In rural areas, horses are still used for work, and riding competitions and festivals are common, particularly in areas like Ilocos and Mindoro.<br><br>

        4. Fling Sports<br>
        These sports include activities such as salambaw, a traditional Filipino fishing technique where participants use a slingshot to throw a small net or spear into the water to catch fish. The skill of accurately throwing objects over long distances is highly valued in many indigenous communities.<br><br>

        5. Wrestling Sports<br>
        Filipino traditional wrestling includes various styles, such as "sipa" and "luksong baka." These games are often played informally in communities and typically involve a combination of strength and skill. "Luksong Baka," for example, involves players jumping over a person who crouches in a "cow" (baka) position, while "Sipa" is a game that involves a small object (usually a washer or a piece of metal) that players kick with their feet, often for competitive purposes.<br><br>

        6. Dart Sports<br>
        Dart sports in the Philippines are usually informal but competitive activities. Traditional dart games, such as using hand-thrown darts made of wood or metal, are played during festivals or community gatherings. These often involve a mix of precision and strategy.<br><br>

        7. Track Sports<br>
        Traditional Filipino track sports include footraces, known as "takbuhan," and obstacle courses. These events were part of various tribal festivals or gatherings and helped in building endurance and physical strength.<br><br>

        8. Traditional Martial Arts<br>
        Apart from Arnis, other traditional Filipino martial arts like "Panantukan" (Filipino boxing) and "Silat" have been practiced for centuries. These martial arts systems blend punches, kicks, joint locks, and grappling techniques. Filipino martial arts focus on efficiency and adaptability, particularly in self-defense scenarios.
